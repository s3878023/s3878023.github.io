                            <h3 style="color:darkblue;">Cloud Computing:</h3>
                            <p>2 specific fields need to be clearly discovered and studied thoroughly to create the website. the first one is Cloud computing and the second is Artificial intelligence-machine learning.</p>
                            <p>First of all, the definition of cloud computing needs to be clearly understood.
                                Microsoft Azure defines that cloud computing is the delivery of computing service which includes servers, storage, databases, networking, software,… over the Internet. “The cloud” offers faster innovation, flexible resources and it is economical.(Microsoft Azure n.d).</p>
                            <p>Cloud computing is named like this because the information being accessed by the user is found remotely in the cloud or also known as a virtual space. Technology companies that provides the cloud services allows users to store data such as files, application on the remote servers. This means that the users don’t need to be in a fixed location to be able to access to their data, they only need the internet and device to connect, allowing everyone to work remotely (Frankenfield 2020).</p>
                            <p>By using cloud, it can be used in many different services such as: <br>
                                -Email <br>
                                -Storage, back up. <br>
                                -Analyzing data. <br>
                                -Delivering software. <br>
                                -etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>Cloud computing is a quite new service but it is now being used by a number of different companies and organizations from big company to small businesses and so much more. Its function is used for different purposes depends on the needs of the customers. Cloud computing is a wise choice for people and businesses for a number of reasons such as it is cost saving and time saving, its speed is incredible as well as its efficiency. </p>
                            <p>Cloud computing is not a piece of technology such as microchip or a lapop. It is a system that consist of the three services : SaaS (Software-as-a-service),  IaaS(Infrastructure-as-a-service),  PaaS(Platform-as-a-service) (Frankenfield 2020).</p>
                            <p>IaaS is a method to deliver all of the information of the OS (Operating System) to the servers and storages through IP-based connectivity. This helps the customers to avoid purchasing expensive software or servers. The most popular examples for the IaaS are IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure (Frankenfield 2020).</p>
                            <p>SaaS includes the licensure of a software application to customers. This type of systems can easily be found in Microsoft Office’s 365 (Frankenfield 2020). </p>
                            <p>The final one is PaaS, which is condisered the one with the most complexity of the three. PaaS shares some similarities with SaaS but the main difference is that instead of delivering software online, it is a platform made for creating software to deliver. This type includes large website like Salesforce.com and Heroku (Frankenfield 2020).</p>
                            <p>Cloud computing is far more than just allowing access to files on multiple devices. The invention of cloud computing enable the customers to check their email and store theirs files or documents on services such as Google Drive or OneDrive. Cloud computing also helps them to back up their data and make sure that all of the data is safe in case the hard drive or the USB crash. </p>
                            <p>Cloud computing would also offers big companies potential of saving their money on paying and construct information management technology. This allows companies to switch from extreme;y expensive server centers to IT department for fast internet connections, where employees can access online and complete their work. </p>
                            <p>Using Cloud computing allows users to remove all vulnerable or lost devices such as USB flash drives or hard drives and bring humanity to a new era.</p>
                            <p>We will see the most dramatic change especially in tech workers, their industry with the help of Cloud computing has become much simpler, they can store and use data from the cloud. This makes it possible for them to manage information remotely and much more efficiently. </p>
                            <p>From there, being at work will no longer be necessary and it is possible to work entirely from home. The appearance of Cloud computing is likely to lead to the hard drive companies may be shut down. people in different professions will also take advantage of the handy Cloud computing to upgrade their businesses. That will affect everyone from me to everyone in the family and around, from work to daily life. </p>
                            <p>Coming soon as we see the advent of 5G technology, the use of the internet will become faster and more convenient. Access to websites via the internet will no longer be a hindrance. This will make everyone's work much faster and more convenient.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3 style="color:darkblue;">Cybersecurity and privacy:</h3>
                            <p>So what is Cybersecurity or also known as information security?<br>
                                -cybersecurity or information security refers to the solutions taken to strengthen a computer or computer system against anonymous access from a hacker. A robust cybersecurity policy protects secure, classified data and avoids it from being hacked by the hands of the third parties. The most popular forms of cyber attacks include phishing, spear phishing and sending malware code to a computer system (AmTrustFinancial n.d)</p>
                            <p>And Data Privacy on its most basic level is a consumer’s understanding of their rights of how their personal information and profile is collected, used, shared and stored. The use of the people information must be showed and explain clearly to customers in the simplest way. In most cases, consumers must accept before their personal information is provided. (AmTrustFinancial n.d)<br>
                                Cybersecurity is a non-stop changing fields, and with all the technologies provided they open up many new ways for hackers to commit cyberattacks. The process of keeping up with the  innovation, security trends is a difficult task. But this is necessary since it helps protecting information and other data from cyber threats, which take various forms. However, there are a few major types of cyber attack: (SearchSecurity n.d)<br>
                                -malware: this is a type of malicious software, which any file or program can be used to threat a user such as viruses, Trojan horses, etc.<br>
                                -ransomware attacks are a form of malware that includes a hacker locking the owner;s computer system files and forcing them to pay in order to unlock the files.<br>
                                -social engineering is a type of attack that base on human interaction to trick the owner into breaking the security procedures in order to access the secret information that is protected. <br> 
                                -phishing : is a form where emails are sent from an imposter who try to present the mail to look just like the reputable sources; but the intention of these emails is to get the sensitive and private data. <br> </p>    
                            <p>Due to the security risks, investments in cybersecurity technologies and services are increasing rapidly. The worldwide spending on cybersecurity products and services had been predicted to grow  approximately $114 billion in 2018. In 2019, it is also expected to grow 11% in the next year regarding North Africa and Middle East. (SearchSecurity n.d) <br>
                                Benefits of the cybersecurity: <br>
                                - Provides protection for all scale of business against malware, ransomware, etc. <br>
                                - Protection for Data and networks. <br>
                                - Reduce the recovery time after a breach. <br>
                                - Guarding end-users information and data. <br>
                                - Gain confidence for both users and developers in the final result/product. <br></p>    
                            <p>Cybersecurity has been widely used and popular at present because the complexity of cyberspace has resulted in the need to protect its information from individual users and businesses of all sizes. The applications of cybersecurity that are most easily found are anti-virus applications, which increase the resistance of the computer to hacker attacks. Big brands that can be mentioned are Bitdefender, McAfee, Norton, ... In addition to using anti-virus applications, large companies often have the option of hiring or training a professional team with the knowledge and skills to help secure the company in terms of network security. <br>
                                This job includes many roles in a team: (Department of computer science n.d) <br>
                                -Security Analyst: this is an employee who will check and analyze data to find security holes in software, hardware, or network of companies or enterprises. Then give suggestions and solutions to fix the problem. <br>
                                -Security Engineer: this is an employee who will perform security monitoring, forensic analysis to detect errors in the system. Investigate and apply new technologies to increase program security. <br>
                                -Security Architect: who will design a system or critical parts of a security system and lead a team to build a new security system. <br>
                                -Security Administrator: installs and effectively manages security systems. Sometimes they will take the job of a security analyst in smaller companies. <br>
                                -Security Software Developer: who develops software for the company from simple tools to complex. <br>
                                -Cryptographer / Cryptologist: The employee uses encryption to strengthen the security of company information or build security software. Also, a person looking for stronger algorithms to put into use. <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>The people most affected when it comes to cybersecurity are small and large businesses. When entering the 4.0 era, participation on the internet is inevitable to increase profits for companies and businesses, while promoting the brand image via cyberspace is much cheaper and more effective. So the need to secure system information and data is the most important thing that needs to be done as soon as possible. <br>
                                From the adoption of cybersecurity technologies, we can see significant developments and advances in technology industries. Developing security software helps developers feel more secure and confident in developing other software. At the same time, users also feel secure when using the products. The cybersecurity industry will grow more and more because cyberspace is also expanding, the complexity of cyberspace also requires tight controls to minimize bad actions such as cyber attacks. <br>
                                Through the development of cybersecurity, this is a great advantage for programmers as the industry will be one of the key industries in the future when cyberspace is still expanding without end. This will lead to a heap of engineers specializing in cybersecurity, creating job opportunities for current programmers. <br>
                                In our daily life perhaps we are surrounded by cybersecurity so we forget about its existence. Cybersecurity has an impact on everyone from life to work, we send an email that is also very secure, we use social networks that are also secured by systems with powerful technologies. so we can enjoy the internet comfortably without having to worry about attacks from hackers. This allows me to exchange correspondence with family members, make video calls with them, and to be assured that I am not being eavesdropped on or leaked. <br>
