                            <p>Because the world is advancing and developing at a fast speed and in order to keep up, I decided to choose an IT path. Since IT is a very broad industry and still has room to grow, I have chosen a fixed field that is web programming. I have always wanted to have complete websites in different fields to be able to maximize their functions and applications in life. <br>
                                And in order to learn the necessary skills, I think I will try to participate in projects on developing small to large websites so that I can understand the needs of specific industries or clients. To be able to make a complete website, I believe that I have to learn and understand the typical languages of web making such as CSS, HTML5, JavaScript.
                            </p>
                            <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">Overview:</h3>
                            <p>Now websites have been built up a lot in different areas like delivery, construction, buying, and selling,... But from my observation, it can be seen that the medical centers are still not really concerned about the development and high applicability of medical web sites. So my idea for this project is about a website used in medicine to create a system of links between hospitals and patients. At present, the countries of the world are still suffering from COVID-19 and are still under quarantine. Therefore, medical examination and treatment will be very difficult and will adversely affect both  patients and  doctors because of the chaotic situation of the epidemic.</p>

                            <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">Motivation:</h3>
                            <p>The main motivation for me to choose this project is because the COVID epidemic is raging and everyone needs a health check so they can stay up to date with their health and protect themselves and those around them. And the safest way is to do home checkups through an online platform, where patients can communicate with their doctor and discuss the symptoms they are experiencing. In addition, this application can also be used after the pandemic has passed because the team of doctors is still short of human resources, so it is impossible to examine each patient. Therefore, an online platform will be of great help for patients and doctors to ensure the health of everyone.</p>
                            <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">Description:</h3>
                            <p>For details, the website will have a home page that shows all reports of epidemics or diseases, newly invented and licensed drugs for use in medicine. Through this home page, patients and family members will be able to quickly and effectively update their medical information. <br>
                                The information posted will be made available through knowledgeable controllers from reputable hospitals to ensure it is accurate and reliable. <br>
                                Firstly, the patient interfaces. They will have an intelligent examination page and can diagnose a patient's general condition based on their answers to listed questions so that they can screen and give the most accurate results possible. This result will then be returned to both the doctor and the patient if the doctor checks and finds that the patient's condition becomes critical. The patient will be contacted directly and if necessary, an ambulance will be contacted to take the patient to the hospital as soon as possible. <br>
                                Patients will also be able to access the shopping cart section on the website to conveniently and quickly order medicines for their illnesses. After a doctor has diagnosed and prescribed a prescription, you can click on the purchase to buy medicine. The website will also try to cooperate with drugstores to deliver goods to customers within the first 24 hours. <br>
                                In terms of answering the question to be able to diagnose the disease, I have found a solution that is to link the website to websites about diseases such as <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/a-to-z">https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/a-to-z</a> . From the information added to these medical web sites, it is possible to compile the data to find and group diseases so that patients can partially understand the problems they are facing. <br>
                                On the doctor's interface, they are grouped into different groups based on their medical experience in different fields. As a result, patients will be examined and diagnosed by experienced doctors. The doctor's interface will also be similar to that of the user but will have a few more special functions and a login account will also be provided by the administrator. <br>
                                The doctor's interface will show a list where it presents the patients that have booked for the appointment. The doctor will also have an intelligent medication suggestion function for the patient through what they have answered in the previous questions.
                            </p>
                            <h3 style="color: darkcyan;">  Tools and Technologies:</h3>
                            <p>For a website to run smoothly, a server is needed to receive all information from the patient and be able to process it. Since there are times when a large number of patients will use the website, the server needs to be powerful enough to be able to process that information quickly. To find a server that could meet the needs at the beginning of web development, the most simple way is to  buy server machines from Dell, here is the link of a server machine <a href="https://maychuviet.vn/product/dell-poweredge-r440-8x2-5-silver-4210r-16gb-1-2tb-sas-h330/">https://maychuviet.vn/product/dell-poweredge-r440-8x2-5-silver-4210r-16gb-1-2tb-sas-h330/</a>.<br>
                                In terms of software, I have planned to use front end writing languages to be able to make a user-friendly interface such as CSS, JavaScript, HTML ... With these languages, it will help me to design a coherent and simple website, avoiding confusing trouble for users but also not boring. The back end will be developed with Python and the Database will be run by MySQL.
                            </p>
                            <h3 style="color: darkcyan;"> Skills Required:</h3>
                            <p>The required skills for me to complete this program is that I have to be fluent in the programming languages mentioned above to be able to design a complete website from front end to back end and use using algorithms that match the problem  to optimize the program. 
                                Since hardware will be used, it will be necessary to learn to facilitate repairs.
                            </p>
                            <h3 style="color: darkcyan;"> Outcome:</h3>
                            <p> If this project is meticulously completed, it will produce a very useful medical website that will have a chance to be widely used by everyone especially doctors. This website will contribute to the meaningful work of medicine and saves more lives than before thanks to the developed Internet, smartphones and so much more. The problems that happen to this project is that sometimes the connections to the main server is too much that it cannot handle and crashes. To prevent that from happening we need to increase the size of the server so that we can manage the extremely large amount of data on the web. Besides, for software problems, to be able to completely overcome it is through customer's feedback to be able to identify and fix immediately.</p>

                            <p>This  project is practical, especially in the current COVID pandemic. It will be of great help for both people, patients, and doctors. Project has shown full evidence, convincing readers. Hope this idea will be developed.</p>

                            <h4 style="color: darkorchid;">ID: s3877327</h4>
                            <p>Overall, I don’t have much to say about your project idea since it is already quite detailed. Your project is a very interesting and practical one, considering the current global situation. If possible, you can elaborate more on the patient’s interface. Currently, there is no way for your website to consider whether the inputs from your patients are reliable or not. Medical centers aren’t that concerned about online medical websites other than being customer services because doctors treating patients based on fraudulent information will be fatal and can cause serious legal action.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h4 style="color: darkorchid;">MY THOUGHT</h4>
                            <P>After sending my project idea to my teammates and receive their feedbacks, I noticed that everyone is happy to see a website that is used for medical and humanitarian purpose. However, I do agree with Duc that the patient’s interface need to elaborate more.  Because this site was built to diagnosing simple diseases which is easy to spot. For complicated and dangerous situations, it is still safer to go to hospitals for treatment. Thanks to Duc, I am able to perfect my website and avoid possible errors.</P>
