                            <p>In order to better understand my future career and job, I arranged to have an appointment with Mr. Nguyen Tuan Kiet, born in 1996. He is currently an IT specialist working for NashTech <a href="https://www.nashtechglobal.com/">link</a>  , Vietnam. Mr. Kiet is currently working as a programmer, web developer. <br>
                                And here is our communication:<br>
                                <span style="color: darkcyan; font-weight: bold;"> Question 1:</span><br>
                                What kind of work is done by the IT professional?<br>
                                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-weight: bold;">Mr.Kiet:</span>IT industry is an extremely large industry with diverse roles, so each person will have different tasks. Personally, I receive client requests after those requests have been carefully analyzed by project managers (PMs). After receiving those requests, we will work in a team or individually depending on the requests from the customer.<br>
                                
                                <span style="color: darkcyan; font-weight: bold;"> Question 2:</span><br>
                                What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? <br>
                                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-weight: bold;">Mr.Kiet:</span> While working, an IT professional will meet many people in many different roles.  Because I work in a foreign company, I have to contact foreign customers regularly in order to exchange the ideas and intentions with them. In addition, I also have to communicate with the IT staff from the client side to be able to work on both sides. I also communicate with teammates and our analysis staff. Finally, the Quality insurance staff, the person who check my final product to see if there is any error in my final product. <br>
                                
                                <span style="color: darkcyan; font-weight: bold;"> Question 3:</span><br> 
                                Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time? <br>
                                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-weight: bold;">Mr.Kiet:</span> This is an interesting question. In my company, I can completely work at home and just make sure the job output is always stable and not late. However, I still prioritize working in the office because at that time I have all the equipment to be able to complete my work effectively. <br>
                                
                                <span style="color: darkcyan; font-weight: bold;"> Question 4:</span><br>
                                What aspect of their position is most challenging? <br>
                                <span style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-weight: bold;">Mr.Kiet:</span>  For me when I fix a mistake in a program, locating the error and finding a way to fix it thoroughly will be the most complicated step of the job. Besides, there are some issues that are also challenging like communicating with customers, they are people who do not have an IT background, so it takes time to explain the problem and come up with solutions for them. And finally, the problem of working for a foreign company is the different timezone and the process where I edit and exchange with clients takes more time, which leads to work efficiency lowered. <br>
                            </p>

                            <p>After talking with Mr. Kiet for a while, I realized that the world of technology is endless. Which major will I become an employee of will probably be decided in the coming years as I study longer in college. And through that, I also understand that IT is not only about writing complete code but also about understanding and communicating effectively with customers to bring out the product that  meets their expectations.</p>
